     <p>Recently we visited Golconda as a part of our induction orientation trip.We had a good time hanging out there in the sun enjoying the jokes of our friends.To give a small a overview of the GOlconda keep reading 
      Golconda fort is situated at a place called Golconda which is 11km away from Hyderabad. The rulers of Qutb Shahi dynasty made the city their capital. Their ruling period was from 1518 to 1687. Golconda has many mines where many diamonds like Kohinoor, Nassak Diamond, Hope Diamond and many other diamonds were produced.The Golconda Fort used to have a vault where the famous Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds were once stored along with other diamonds.[10]

      Golconda is renowned for the diamonds found on the south-east at Kollur Mine near Kollur, Guntur district, Paritala and Atkur in Krishna district and cut in the city during the Kakatiya reign. At that time, India had the only known diamond mines in the world. Golkonda was the market city of the diamond trade, and gems sold there came from a number of mines. The fortress-city within the walls was famous for diamond trade.
