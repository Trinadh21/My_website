    <p>The area of the institute campus is 66 acres (approx. 267,000 m²). Four buildings house the corporate schools and research centers. In addition to this, the academic building has the lecture halls, tutorial rooms, computer and electronics labs and offices of the administration and faculty. The buildings are named after the mountain ranges, Nilgiri, Vindhya and Himalaya.

      All students are provided hostel rooms. First-year and second-year students who have enrolled in a bachelor's or dual-degree program are required to share rooms (double occupancy), whereas from the third-year onwards, the students have single occupancy.[citation needed] The institute has a guest house with four air-conditioned suites. Two hostels for men and one for women have a total of about 1200 rooms. An optical fiber network connects all buildings on campus including the hostels.
      
      The institute has air-conditioned computer laboratories, allocated batch-wise to students. The PC-to-student ratio is about 1:2. All computers are part of an intranet (1 Gbit/s backbone). The institute has high bandwidth (100 Mbit/s) Internet connectivity round the clock. Students undertaking research can access computational facilities 24/7. All notices and information are sent over the campus email. From couriers to mess registration, everything is notified via specific portals (internal sites). Some areas of the institute, like a few parts of Himalaya, Nilgiri and library, are connected by Wi-Fi.
      
      IIIT-H also hosts T-Hub,[17] which is said to be India's biggest incubation center, in collaboration with Indian School of Business and Nalsar University of Law. Its aim is to provide a supportive environment, along with financial and mentorship support to new startups in the region. </p>
